# Resume Project

<trigger>
Use this flow when:
- Starting a new session on an existing project
- User says "continue", "what's next", "where were we", "resume"
- Any planning operation when .planning/ already exists
- User returns after time away from project
</trigger>

<purpose>
Instantly restore full project context so "Where were we?" has an immediate, complete answer.
</purpose>

<process>

<step name="detect_existing_project">
Check if this is an existing project:

```sh
ls .planning/state.md 2>/dev/null && echo "Project exists"
ls .planning/roadmap.md 2>/dev/null && echo "Roadmap exists"
ls .planning/project.md 2>/dev/null && echo "Project file exists"
```

**If state.md exists:** Proceed to load_state
**If only roadmap.md/project.md exist:** Offer to reconstruct state.md
**If .planning/ doesn't exist:** This is a new project - route to /drive:new-project
</step>

<step name="load_state">

Read and parse state.md, then project.md:

```sh
cat .planning/state.md
cat .planning/project.md
```

**From state.md extract:**

- **Project Reference**: Core value and current focus
- **Current Position**: Phase X of Y, Plan A of B, Status
- **Progress**: Visual progress bar
- **Recent Decisions**: Key decisions affecting current work
- **Pending Todos**: Ideas captured during sessions
- **Blockers/Concerns**: Issues carried forward
- **Session Continuity**: Where we left off, any resume files

**From project.md extract:**

- **What This Is**: Current accurate description
- **Requirements**: Validated, Active, Out of Scope
- **Key Decisions**: Full decision log with outcomes
- **Constraints**: Hard limits on implementation

</step>

<step name="check_incomplete_work">
Look for incomplete work that needs attention:

```sh
# Check for continue-here files (mid-plan resumption)
ls .planning/phases/*/.continue-here*.md 2>/dev/null

# Check for plans without summaries (incomplete execution)
for plan in .planning/phases/*/*-plan.md; do
  summary="${plan/PLAN/SUMMARY}"
  [ ! -f "$summary" ] && echo "Incomplete: $plan"
done 2>/dev/null

# Check for interrupted agents
if [ -f .planning/current-agent-id.txt ] && [ -s .planning/current-agent-id.txt ]; then
  AGENT_ID=$(cat .planning/current-agent-id.txt | tr -d '\n')
  echo "Interrupted agent: $AGENT_ID"
fi
```

**If .continue-here file exists:**

- This is a mid-plan resumption point
- Read the file for specific resumption context
- Flag: "Found mid-plan checkpoint"

**If PLAN without SUMMARY exists:**

- Execution was started but not completed
- Flag: "Found incomplete plan execution"

**If interrupted agent found:**

- Subagent was spawned but session ended before completion
- Read agent-history.json for task details
- Flag: "Found interrupted agent"
  </step>

<step name="present_status">
Present complete project status to user:

```sh
---
PROJECT STATUS

  Building: [one-liner from project.md "What This Is"]

  Phase: [X] of [Y] - [Phase name]
  Plan:  [A] of [B] - [Status]
  Progress: [######....] XX%

  Last activity: [date] - [what happened]
---

[If incomplete work found:]
WARNING  Incomplete work detected:
    - [.continue-here file or incomplete plan]

[If interrupted agent found:]
WARNING  Interrupted agent detected:
    Agent ID: [id]
    Task: [task description from agent-history.json]
    Interrupted: [timestamp]

    Resume with: Task tool (resume parameter with agent ID)

[If pending todos exist:]
PLANNED [N] pending todos -- /drive:check-todos to review

[If blockers exist:]
WARNING  Carried concerns:
    - [blocker 1]
    - [blocker 2]

[If alignment is not ✓:]
WARNING  Brief alignment: [status] - [assessment]
```

</step>

<step name="determine_next_action">
Based on project state, determine the most logical next action:

**If interrupted agent exists:**
-> Primary: Resume interrupted agent (Task tool with resume parameter)
-> Option: Start fresh (abandon agent work)

**If .continue-here file exists:**
-> Primary: Resume from checkpoint
-> Option: Start fresh on current plan

**If incomplete plan (PLAN without SUMMARY):**
-> Primary: Complete the incomplete plan
-> Option: Abandon and move on

**If phase in progress, all plans complete:**
-> Primary: Transition to next phase
-> Option: Review completed work

**If phase ready to plan:**
-> Check if context.md exists for this phase:

- If context.md missing:
  -> Primary: Discuss phase vision (how user imagines it working)
  -> Secondary: Plan directly (skip context gathering)
- If context.md exists:
  -> Primary: Plan the phase
  -> Option: Review roadmap

**If phase ready to execute:**
-> Primary: Execute next plan
-> Option: Review the plan first
</step>

<step name="offer_options">
Present contextual options based on project state:

```
What would you like to do?

[Primary action based on state - e.g.:]
1. Resume interrupted agent [if interrupted agent found]
   OR
1. Execute phase (/drive:execute-phase {phase})
   OR
1. Discuss Phase 3 context (/drive:discuss-phase 3) [if context.md missing]
   OR
1. Plan Phase 3 (/drive:plan-phase 3) [if context.md exists or discuss option declined]

[Secondary options:]
2. Review current phase status
3. Check pending todos ([N] pending)
4. Review brief alignment
5. Something else
```

**Note:** When offering phase planning, check for context.md existence first:

```sh
ls .planning/phases/XX-name/*-context.md 2>/dev/null
```

If missing, suggest discuss-phase before plan. If exists, offer plan directly.

Wait for user selection.
</step>

<step name="route_to_flow">
Based on user selection, route to appropriate flow:

- **Execute plan** -> Show command for user to run after clearing:

  ```
  ---

  ## > Next Up

  **{phase}-{plan}: [Plan Name]** -- [objective from plan.md]

  `/drive:execute-phase {phase}`

  <sub>`/clear` first -> fresh context window</sub>

  ---
  ```

- **Plan phase** -> Show command for user to run after clearing:

  ```
  ---

  ## > Next Up

  **Phase [N]: [Name]** -- [Goal from roadmap.md]

  `/drive:plan-phase [phase-number]`

  <sub>`/clear` first -> fresh context window</sub>

  ---

  **Also available:**
  - `/drive:discuss-phase [N]` -- gather context first
  - `/drive:research-phase [N]` -- investigate unknowns

  ---
  ```

- **Transition** -> ./transition.md
- **Check todos** -> Read .planning/todos/pending/, present summary
- **Review alignment** -> Read project.md, compare to current state
- **Something else** -> Ask what they need
</step>

<step name="update_session">
Before proceeding to routed flow, update session continuity:

Update state.md:

```markdown
## Session Continuity

Last session: [now]
Stopped at: Session resumed, proceeding to [action]
Resume file: [updated if applicable]
```

This ensures if session ends unexpectedly, next resume knows the state.
</step>

</process>

<reconstruction>
If state.md is missing but other artifacts exist:

"state.md missing. Reconstructing from artifacts..."

1. Read project.md -> Extract "What This Is" and Core Value
2. Read roadmap.md -> Determine phases, find current position
3. Scan \*-summary.md files -> Extract decisions, concerns
4. Count pending todos in .planning/todos/pending/
5. Check for .continue-here files -> Session continuity

Reconstruct and write state.md, then proceed normally.

This handles cases where:

- Project predates state.md introduction
- File was accidentally deleted
- Cloning repo without full .planning/ state
  </reconstruction>

<quick_resume>
If user says "continue" or "go":

- Load state silently
- Determine primary action
- Execute immediately without presenting options

"Continuing from [state]... [action]"
</quick_resume>

<success_criteria>
Resume is complete when:

- [ ] state.md loaded (or reconstructed)
- [ ] Incomplete work detected and flagged
- [ ] Clear status presented to user
- [ ] Contextual next actions offered
- [ ] User knows exactly where project stands
- [ ] Session continuity updated
      </success_criteria>
